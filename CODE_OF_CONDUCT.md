# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of **OpenXHealth** pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
